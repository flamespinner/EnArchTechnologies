    <h1>About EnArch Technologies</h1>
    <p><br/>Though we are not completely kicked off yet, you can still browse around our site and learn about what will be coming! While we are developing this site a lot of new things are coming in and hopefully we will have stuff to offer on our store within the next year. We are currently working on a number of projects (which is difficult with only a handful of people), including headphones, some games, and even an 8-bit gaming console. So yes, there is going to be a lot of stuff coming within the next few years.<br /><br />
EnArch technologies is a small company based out of Minnesota, USA. We are only a handful of high school students who are interested in bettering the community of science and technology. We make games, design software, develop websites (at a very reasonable rate), and are currently working on a few big products that will (hopefully) be pretty successful and will spark interest in buyers. Check out the rest of our site for more info.</p>
