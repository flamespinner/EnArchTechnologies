EnArchTechnologies
==================

Offical Website Repository of EnArch Technologies Company Website. 
The live version can be found at [http://fsp.dbztech.com]. 
Any questions or suggestions can be e-mailed to enarchtech@gmail.com. This website is provided as open source.

Note that we do a lot of reformatting, and there may be code in the GitHub that is unused, unfinished, or simply poorly coded as a placeholder. It may also be different than what is on the live site. So beware -- do not expect this to be professionally written code at this moment in time. It may take a while for this code to be fully functional and clean.

Files with _es or _ru or _zh after them are the Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin versions, respectively. They are NOT implemented yet, and most of them use old site code. As of February 2014, languages are not implemented in the new site theme. They should be by the end of May (that is the goal).


  You may feel free to use it in part or in whole (But not to mislead people, that's a crime).
