    <p> We are not up to 100% yet. As you may see, styles and stuff are not completely implemented. If not, have no fear. We will be 100% running soon<br /><br />
EnArch technologies is a small company based out of Minnesota, USA. We are only a handful of high school students who are interested in bettering the community of science and technology. We make games, design software, develop websites (at a very reasonable rate), and are currently working on a few big products that will (hopefully) be pretty successful and will spark interest in buyers. Check out the rest of our site for more info.</p>
